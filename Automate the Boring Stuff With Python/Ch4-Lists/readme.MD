## Comma Code

Taken from the book, this program aims to do the following:

> Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with and inserted before the last item. For example, passing the previous spam list to the function would return 'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats'. But your function should be able to work with any list value passed to it. Be sure to test the case where an empty list [] is passed to your function.

In `Lines 4-8`, we define some lists that we can pass in the function that we are gonna create. The `enumerate` function takes in a list, and depending on the number of items in the list, prints out the items separated with `commas` and/or `and`.

_Note:_ We can instead ask the user for what list to view, however, that requires the lists to be mapped with the input string using a `dict`, something that hasn't been covered in this chapter. As such, we are hard coding what list to pass in to the function. This still accomplishes the intended instruction.
