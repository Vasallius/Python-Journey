# Python-Journey

Greetings, my name is Jed and this repository serves as a collection of all my project files and code as I learn Python.

### Python For Everybody

This folder contains files related to the Python For Everybody Specialization Course offered at https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python 

### Automate the Boring Stuff With Python

This folder contains files related to the book "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python" authored by Al Sweigart. Book can be found here: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter0/

Since the book didn't give solutions to **Practice Projects**, I have tried to provide my own set of solutions for anyone looking to try to solve them. However, they are not yet well documented.
